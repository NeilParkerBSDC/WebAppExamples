The following files are included in this repository

## 1) BasicCalcCompleted.html

This file is a basic calculator app. I have included the Style (CSS), Script (JavaScript

## 2) BasicCalcCompletedSeparateButtons.html

This is a variation on th files above with separate buttons for each operation. This means putting each operation (i.e. +, -, *, /) into different functions which are called in turn by the four seprate buttons

## 3) TradCalc.html

This calculator takes a different approach. The aim is to replicate a tradition hand held calculator. There are different buttons for all the input numbers and opertors etc. Each calls different function:
